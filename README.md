## My process
- First I set up the semantic structure of the HTML file.
- Secondly I adapted the design from the Figma file to contain the extra features. 
- Thirdly I researched how to implement the different JavaScript functionalities that I wanted to add. 
- Fourthly added the JavaScript functionality.
- Finally Made the app responsive by changing the flex-direction for mobile devices. 

### Languages and Tools

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Figma


### What I Learnt

- How to properly research functionalities that you haven't used before. The Codercoder video linked in the acknowledgements section shows this process really well.
- How to create a Dark/Light Theme with CSS variables and how to make it accesible for screen readers by adding the aria label.
- Using display Block vs using display Flex to properly position different elements.
- How to use user input to modify a JavaScript function.
- How to copy generated passwords to the clipboard.
