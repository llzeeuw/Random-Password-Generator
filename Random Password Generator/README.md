## My process
- First I set up the semantic structure of the HTML file.
- Secondly I adapted the design from the Figma file so the colors would be a bit more bold with CSS. 
- Thirdly I added the JavaScript functionality.
- Made the app responsive by changing the flex-direction for mobile devices. 

### Languages and Tools

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Figma


### What I Learnt

- How to create a Dark/Light Theme and how to make it accesible for screen readers by adding the aria label.
- Using display Block vs using display Flex to properly position different items.
